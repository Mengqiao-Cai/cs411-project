Idea 1: Concert Recommendation App

	This application take’s a user’s Spotify login. It then analyzes their listening history to determine what artists/genres of music they like, and recommends concerts based on this information. Preferences can be made on the date and distance of the concerts. Suitable API’s for this are Spotify and Ticketmaster. A database will store user activity such as search history and/or preferences. Third-party authentication will be through Spotify.

Idea 2: Flash Flood Elevation App

	This application take’s a user’s location, and first determines if the location is at risk of flash floods. If so, it will suggest nearby locations of higher altitude. This app will utilize weather and map API’s, authenticate users via Facebook, and register users and their search history to a database.
